Depending on the criticality, volume, or perishability of the information being protected,\r\nlonger or shorter operational lifetimes may be established for cryptographic keys. Some private-sector\r\norganizations neither change key variables and/or certificates nor make provision for users to change the keys\r\nand/or certificates. This is not recommended if the information has any privacy or security value. Ideally, an\r\norganization controls cryptoperiod determinations for the keys that protect its information.\r\n```",
